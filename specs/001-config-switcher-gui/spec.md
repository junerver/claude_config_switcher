# Feature Specification: Claude Code Configuration Switcher

**Feature Branch**: `001-config-switcher-gui`
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "我要构建一个基于python的gui程序,主要用于方便的切换claude code的配置文件,它可以维护多个json字符串与供应商的键值对内容(增删改查),通过简单的双击可以将这个配置应用到claude code的配置中(用选中的内容替换当前的配置)"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Switch Configuration Profiles (Priority: P1)

A user wants to quickly switch between different Claude Code configuration profiles (e.g., development vs. production API keys, different vendor settings) without manually editing JSON files. They double-click a profile in the GUI and the application immediately applies it to Claude Code's configuration.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - enabling fast configuration switching. Without this, users continue manual file editing which is error-prone and time-consuming.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a profile, double-clicking it, and verifying the Claude Code configuration file reflects the selected profile content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple configuration profiles exist, **When** user double-clicks a profile, **Then** Claude Code's configuration file is updated with the selected profile's content
2. **Given** Claude Code is running, **When** user switches to a different profile, **Then** the configuration change is immediately reflected without requiring application restart
3. **Given** a profile is selected, **When** user views Claude Code's configuration file, **Then** the content matches the selected profile exactly

---

### User Story 2 - Manage Configuration Profiles (Priority: P2)

A user needs to create, edit, rename, duplicate, and delete configuration profiles to maintain different Claude Code setups for various scenarios (different API providers, development/testing/production environments, different model configurations).

**Why this priority**: Profile management is essential but builds on the switching capability. Users need at least 2 profiles to make switching valuable, making this a natural second priority.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by performing all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on profiles and verifying each profile stores the correct key-value configuration data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is open, **When** user creates a new profile with name and JSON configuration, **Then** the profile appears in the profile list
2. **Given** an existing profile, **When** user edits the profile's JSON content or vendor key-value pairs, **Then** the changes are saved and persist across application restarts
3. **Given** multiple profiles exist, **When** user deletes a profile, **Then** the profile is removed from the list and cannot be selected for switching
4. **Given** a profile exists, **When** user renames the profile, **Then** the profile retains its configuration data but displays with the new name
5. **Given** a profile exists, **When** user duplicates the profile, **Then** a new profile is created with identical configuration but a unique name

---

### User Story 3 - View and Validate Profiles (Priority: P3)

A user wants to preview a profile's configuration content before applying it and receive warnings if the configuration appears invalid (e.g., malformed JSON, missing required fields).

**Why this priority**: Validation adds safety and confidence but isn't strictly necessary for basic switching functionality. Users can verify changes manually after switching.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting a profile and viewing its full JSON content in the GUI, and by attempting to create or edit profiles with invalid JSON to verify validation warnings appear.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a profile is selected, **When** user views profile details, **Then** the complete JSON configuration is displayed in a readable format
2. **Given** user is editing a profile, **When** the JSON content contains syntax errors, **Then** the application displays a validation error and prevents saving
3. **Given** user is about to apply a profile, **When** the configuration contains potentially problematic values, **Then** the application shows a warning but allows the user to proceed
4. **Given** multiple profiles exist, **When** user views the profile list, **Then** each profile displays its name and a brief summary of key configuration values

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the Claude Code configuration file is read-only or locked by another process?
- How does the system handle malformed JSON in existing profiles during application startup?
- What happens when two profiles have identical names?
- How does the application behave if the Claude Code configuration file path is invalid or doesn't exist?
- What happens when a user attempts to delete the currently active profile?
- How does the system handle very large JSON configurations (e.g., >100KB)?
- What happens if the application crashes while writing to the Claude Code configuration file?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Application MUST display a list of all saved configuration profiles with their names
- **FR-002**: Application MUST allow users to create new profiles by providing a name and JSON configuration content
- **FR-003**: Application MUST allow users to edit existing profile names and configuration content
- **FR-004**: Application MUST allow users to delete profiles from the profile list
- **FR-005**: Application MUST allow users to duplicate existing profiles to create new profiles with identical configuration
- **FR-006**: Application MUST apply the selected profile's configuration to Claude Code's configuration file when double-clicked
- **FR-007**: Application MUST persist all profile data across application restarts
- **FR-008**: Application MUST validate JSON syntax when users create or edit profile configurations
- **FR-009**: Application MUST support storing both complete JSON configuration strings and individual key-value pairs for vendor-specific settings
- **FR-010**: Application MUST prevent duplicate profile names within the same profile list
- **FR-011**: Application MUST provide visual feedback (success/error indicators) after applying a configuration
- **FR-012**: Application MUST preserve the original Claude Code configuration file before applying changes
- **FR-013**: Application MUST handle file access errors gracefully with user-friendly error messages
- **FR-014**: Application MUST allow users to view the complete configuration content of any profile
- **FR-015**: Application MUST indicate which profile is currently active (if tracking is implemented)

### Assumptions

- Claude Code configuration file location is known and accessible (default location or user-configurable)
- Configuration changes take effect in Claude Code without requiring the application to restart (Claude Code hot-reloads configuration)
- Users have write permissions to the Claude Code configuration file
- Profiles are stored locally on the user's machine (no cloud sync required initially)
- JSON configuration structure follows Claude Code's expected schema
- Application supports standard desktop windowing operations (minimize, maximize, close)

### Key Entities

- **Configuration Profile**: A named collection of configuration settings for Claude Code. Contains a unique name, full JSON configuration string, and optional key-value pairs for vendor-specific settings. Can be created, edited, duplicated, and deleted. Represents a complete snapshot of Claude Code settings.

- **Vendor Key-Value Pair**: A configuration setting stored as a key and value. Represents individual configuration parameters within a profile (e.g., `api_key: sk-xxxxx`, `model: claude-3-opus`). Multiple pairs can exist within a single profile.

- **Claude Code Configuration File**: The target file where configuration changes are applied. Represents the active Claude Code settings. Has a file path and current content that gets replaced when a profile is applied.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can switch between configuration profiles in under 5 seconds from opening the application to applying a new configuration
- **SC-002**: Profile management operations (create, edit, delete) complete in under 10 seconds each
- **SC-003**: 100% of valid JSON configurations apply successfully without corrupting the Claude Code configuration file
- **SC-004**: Configuration changes are correctly reflected in Claude Code within 2 seconds of applying a profile
- **SC-005**: Application handles at least 50 saved profiles without performance degradation
- **SC-006**: 95% of users successfully switch configurations on their first attempt without errors
- **SC-007**: Application startup time is under 3 seconds with up to 50 saved profiles

# Specification Quality Checklist: Claude Code Configuration Switcher

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and pass inspection:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification is written in user-focused language without mentioning Python, GUI frameworks, or specific technologies. All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 15 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all necessary details have been specified with reasonable defaults documented in the Assumptions section.

3. **Success Criteria Quality**: All 7 success criteria are measurable (specific time/percentage targets) and technology-agnostic (focus on user outcomes like "switch configurations in under 5 seconds" rather than implementation details).

4. **Feature Readiness**: Three prioritized user stories with complete acceptance scenarios. Edge cases identified. Scope is bounded to local desktop application with profile management and configuration switching.

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` command
- No spec updates required
- All acceptance criteria are independently testable
- Assumptions section documents reasonable defaults (e.g., configuration file location, permissions, storage location)
